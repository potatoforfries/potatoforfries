# Hi there 👋 I'm PotatoForFries

I'm a beginner developer diving deep into:

- 🛡️ Cryptography (building my own one-time pad encryption tool)
- 🧠 Computer science fundamentals (networking, OS, databases)
- 🧪 Python scripting & automation
- 💻 Currently learning: GitHub, modular Python, VS Code

## 🛠️ Projects
- 🔐 [One-Time Pad Encryptor](https://github.com/potatoforfries/simple-one-time-pad): My first encryption tool with modular code and command-line interface
- 🧪 More soon...

## 📚 My Learning Journey
I’m building in public and sharing everything I learn. Follow along as I:
- Learn cryptography from scratch (`Crypto 101`)
- Build an encrypted chat app from scratch
